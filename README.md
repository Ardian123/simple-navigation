# Instruction

Hello there ðŸ¤“. Please follow the instruction:


## 1. General

1. Create a new `html` file.
1. Create a new `CSS` and `JS` file. 
1. Add some simple reset / normalize styles to your `CSS` file.
1. Add a simple function that will wait for a page when it's loaded (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1033398/how-to-execute-a-function-when-page-has-fully-loaded).


## 2. HTML stuff

1. Make a navigation using: `nav`, `ul`, `img`, `a` and `button` elements.
1. In a navigation, you should have:
- Image of logo (please use `.svg` attached in a repo),
- a small gap between logo and menu,
- three links: `About us`, `Articles` and `Contact` with urls: `about-us`, `articles` and `contact` ....,
- `button` with two svg images (please use `.svg`s attached in a repo) depending on open / close menu.


## 3. CSS stuff
1. Nothing fancy. Just a regular navbar with a breakpoint on a `768px` width.
1. If width of a screen is narrower than `768px` hide menu, show button with menu toggler and show links only if menu toggler is active.
1. If width of a screen is broader than `768px` place all elements: logo, navigation links in the same line. Menu toggler button should be hidden.

## 4. JS stuff
1. Add `eventListener` to menu toggler button to handle clicks. Clicking on a button should add or remove (toggle) `class` (`classList`) (let's call it `js-menu-active`).


## Some help
1. If something doesn't work try to `console.log` some values and check what's happening.
